# Hfetchüìö‚öîÔ∏è

A Clio Aite themed neofetch parody written in C just for lulz. Based off of [jfetch](https://github.com/jffops/jfetch).

Displays information about your operating system (Linux-only), software and hardware, and a cool Cliorb ascii animation.

# Usage

You can build the executable using `make` or by running the `./build.sh` script.

If you use an Arch-based system you can install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hfetch-git)

hfetch has no configuration files, so if you want to remove/rearrange the outputs you will need to edit the prints_stats function and recompile the program.

# Extras

The animation is generated by a python script (./animation/converter.py) from a cliorb.gif and embedded into the C code.
In order to tinker with it you will need to install numpy and opencv as dependencies.

# Optional dependencies

* amdgpu_top (For detecting AMD GPUs)
* nvidia / nvidia-open (For detecting NVIDIA GPUs)
